Unsupervised learning
- Clustering algorithms - group data based on some pattern without being given labels. Algorithm automatically figures out if some datapoints are 'alike'
- Anomaly detection - find outliers
- Dimensionality reduction - data compression
- Data X doesnt come with a label Y


Gradient descent
- if we have cost function L(x) then we start with an initial guess vector x_0 and make new estimate of the minimum location in the following way:
    x_new = x_old - alpha * grad(L(x))

here alpha is the learning rate
